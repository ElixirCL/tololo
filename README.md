# 🔭 Tololo E-commerce

> High in the mountains of the Coquimbo region of Chile lies a peak called Cerro Tololo, whose name means “on the edge of the abyss,” a description given to the mountain by the ancient Diaguita people, in reference to its rugged geography on its northeastern side.

**Tololo** is a set of _Elixir_ components that bring functionality akin to Shopify and other e-commerce platforms to
[Phoenix Framework](https://phoenixframework.org/). You have complete freedom to create your own storefront(s), but we've already done the hard work for you in  the backend.

> [!CAUTION]
> Version 1.x is currently in alpha release. We recommend this version for new projects, however, it is not feature-complete and therefore may not be deemed production-ready.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Tololo is mainly targeted to Chilean's market needs.

## Features

Tololo E-commerce is mainly inspired by [Lunar PHP](https://github.com/lunarphp/lunar) and aims to be similar in scope and features.

- **Ecommerce Engine**: Based around [Ash Framework](https://ash-hq.org/) models, the e-commerce core provides all the functionality you need to create an online store.
- **Backoffice**: Manage your catalogue, customers and orders in our modern and extendable admin area, built in _Phoenix LiveView_.
- **API**: Power your storefront or mobile app via Tololo's API.

### Learning

This project is not only a product that can be used in the Real World™, but is meant to be used as an example to learn how to make an professional _Elixir_ artifact.
So we take great care in documentation for developers.

# 🔭 Tololo E-commerce

> High in the mountains of the Coquimbo region of Chile lies a peak called Cerro Tololo, whose name means “on the edge of the abyss,” a description given to the mountain by the ancient Diaguita people, in reference to its rugged geography on its northeastern side.

**Tololo** is an open-source package that brings the power of modern headless e-commerce functionality to Elixir's [Phoenix Framework](https://phoenixframework.org/).

## Features

Tololo E-commerce is mainly inspired by [Lunar PHP](https://github.com/lunarphp/lunar) and aims to be similar in scope and features.

- **Ecommerce Engine**: Based around [Ash Framework](https://ash-hq.org/) models, the e-commerce core provides all the functionality you need to create an online store. 
- **Backoffice**: Manage your catalogue, customers and orders in our modern and extendable admin area, built in _Phoenix LiveView_.
- **API**: Power your storefront or mobile app via Tololo's API.
